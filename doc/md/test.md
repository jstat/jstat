## Statistical Tests

The test module includes methods that enact popular statistical tests.
The tests that are implemented are Z tests, T tests, and F tests.
Also included are methods for developing confidence intervals. Currently
regression is not included but it should be included soon (once matrix
inversion is fixed).

## Statistics Instance Functionality

### zscore( value[, flag])

Returns the z-score of the value taking the jStat object as the observed
values. Flag==true denotes use of sample standard deviation.

### ztest( value, sides[, flag])

Returns the p-value of the value taking the jStat object as the observed
values. Sides is an integer value 1 or 2 denoting a 1 or 2 sided z-test.
The test defaults to a 2 sided z-test if sides is not specified.Flag==true
denotes use of sample standard devaition.

### tscore( value)

Returns the t-score of the value taking the jStat object as the observed
values.

### ttest( value, sides)

Returns the p-value of the value taking the jStat object as the observed
values. Sides is an integer value 1 or 2 denoting a 1 or 2 sided t-test.
The test defaults to a 2 sided t-test if sides is not specified.

### anovafscore()

Returns the f-score of the ANOVA test on the arrays of the jStat object.

### anovaftest()

Returns the p-value of an ANOVA test on the arrays of the jStat object.

## Static Methods 

## Z Statistics

### jStat.zscore( value, mean, sd)

Returns the z-score of value given the mean and the standard deviation
of the test.

### jStat.zscore( value, array[, flag])

Returns the z-score of value given the data from array. Flag==true denotes
use of the sample standard deviation.

### jStat.ztest( value, mean, sd, sides)

Returns the p-value of a the z-test of value given the mean and standard
deviation of the test. Sides is an integer value 1 or 2 denoting a
one or two sided z-test. If sides is not specified the test defaults
to a two sided z-test.

### jStat.ztest( zscore, sides)

Returns the p-value of the z-score. Sides is an integer value 1 or 2
denoting a one or two sided z-test. If sides is not specified the test
defaults to a two sided z-test

### jStat.ztest( value, array, sides[, flag])

Returns the p-value of value given the data from the array. Sides is
an integer value 1 or 2 denoting a one or two sided z-test. If sides
is not specified the test defaults to a two sided z-test. flag==true
denotes the use of the sample standard deviation.

## T Statistics

### jStat.tscore( value, mean, sd, n)

Returns the t-score of the value given the mean, standard deviation,
and the sample size n.

### jStat.tscore( value, array)

Returns the t-score of value given the data from the array.

### jStat.ttest( value, mean, sd, n, sides)

Returns the p-value of value given the mean, standard deviation,
and the sample size n. Sides is an integer value 1 or 2 denoting
a one or two sided t-test. If sides is not specified the test
defaults to a two sided t-test.

### jStat.ttest( tscore, n, sides)

Returns the p-value of the t-score given the sample size n. Sides 
is an integer value 1 or 2 denoting a one or two sided t-test. 
If sides is not specified the test defaults to a two sided t-test. 

### jStat.ttest( value, array, sides)

Returns the p-value of the value given the data in the array.
Sides is an integer value 1 or 2 denoting a one or two sided 
t-test. If sides is not specified the test defaults to a two 
sided t-test.

## F Statistics

### jStat.anovafscore( array1, array2, ..., arrayn)

Returns the f-score of an ANOVA on the arrays.

### jStat.anovafscore( [array1,array2, ...,arrayn])

Returns the f-score of an ANOVA on the arrays.

### jStat.anovaftest( array1, array2, ...., arrayn)

Returns the p-value of the f-statistic from the ANOVA
test on the arrays.

### jStat.ftest( fscore, df1, df2)

Returns the p-value for the fscore with a numerator degress
of freedom df1 and the denominator degrees of freedom df2

## Confidence Intervals

### jStat.normalci( value, alpha, sd, n)

Returns a 1-alpha confidence interval for the value given
a normal distribution with a standard deviation sd and a
sample size n
  
### jStat.normalci( value, alpha, array)

Returns a 1-alpha confidence interval for the value given
a normal distribution in the data from the array.

### jStat.tci( value, alpha, sd, n)

Returns a 1-alpha confidence interval for the value given
the standard deviation and the sample size n.

### jStat.tci( value, alpha, array)

Returns a 1-alpha confidence interval for the value given
the data from the array.

### jStat.oneSidedDifferenceOfProportions( p1, n1, p2, n2)

Returns the p-value for a 1-sided test for the difference
between two proportions. p1 is the sample proportion for
the first sample, whereas p2 is the sample proportion for
the second sample. Similiarly, n1 is the sample size of the
first sample and n2 is the sample size for the second sample.

### jStat.twoSidedDifferenceOfProportions( p1, n1, p2, n2)

Returns the p-value for a 2-sided test for the difference
between two proportions. p1 is the sample proportion for
the first sample, whereas p2 is the sample proportion for
the second sample. Similiarly, n1 is the sample size of the
first sample and n2 is the sample size for the second sample.
